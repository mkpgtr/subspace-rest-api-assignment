# Some honest points I want to make :

1. I used chatgpt to learn how to make curl request. it was my first time that I made a curl request from express js via exec function. I found it cool.
2. I used chatgpt once again when I got stuck in memoization. I was familiar with caching but I was getting some undefined values and
    so the 'Promise' code I took help from chatGpt.


3. Rest all of the project is entirely coded by me. I am ready & eager to discuss the project for techincal round so that the authenticity of my code can be verified.

4. I really enjoyed making this project. Thank you Subspace for giving me an opportunity to solve this problem-statement.

# Regarding Lodash functions

1. I wrote the Lodash functions by researching the documentation of Lodash & also some google.
2. I can write this kind of code while I am given enough time. I truly enjoyed coding this project. 

# Regarding memoization & how it works here.

1. I have set a setTimeInterval Function that makes the memoCache an empty object every 60 seconds.
2. So our cached results stay for 60 seconds as of now. It can be changed as per our wish.
3. To verify if my caching is working or not, I wrote newFetch function which runs when our cache expires.
4. And when we are using cache, a message is loggedd to the console saying notifying the same.
5. All this can be found inside the memoization folder.

# Regarding Error Handling

1. I had earlier done error-handling while learning from udemy so it was a good revision of what I learnt.
2. I know it could have been much better yet I tried to think of a few possible scenarios and handle those errors. 


# Additional note

1. I also added pagination from my side.
2. Tried some error-handling. I know it could have been better but still it was interesting to attempt it.
3. I had earlier done memoization in another internship assignment in mysql, so it was quite a refresher.
